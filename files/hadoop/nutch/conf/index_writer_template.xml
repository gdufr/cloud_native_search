# the cloudsearch indexer appears to ignore these mapping settings in the current version.  They are blank to prevent confusion
# The metatag parser and cloudsearch indexer will do the following:
#   all the metatags will be prefixed with metatag_
#   all the uppercase letters will be changed to lowercase
#   all the non-letter characters will be changed to _
#     for instance: twitter.Title in the webpage becomes metatag_twitter_title in cloudsearch
#
#   The cloudsearch indexer will not upload fields that do not already exist in cloudsearch
#     e.g. if the metatag_twitter_title field does not exist in cloudsearch then the indexer will not include it in the upload
