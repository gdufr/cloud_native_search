        "structure": "Each entry in this file uses the id as the key.  This id is passed from the client when the user executes a search.  The value is an array of objects.  Each object contains the field in CloudSearch that should be searched (match_field) and the corresponding value. For example: the id_2 should return results from both the (exact match) host www.otherdomain.com and (partial match) urls otherRelatedDomain.com. Weather a search includes only exact or partial matches is an artifact of the data types in CloudSearch and is not configurable in this file. The host field is a literal (exact match only), the url field is a text (partial matching)"
