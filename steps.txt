Update common.vars.tf to include the new workspace variables: 

in each of the numbered sequence directories ("1terraform-state-setup/terraform.config.tf ", "2cloudsearch_setup/terraform.config.tf "â€¦ ) update the bucket and dynamodb_table  in the terraform.config.tf file to the new values (to match whatever you set them to in the common.vars.tf): 

    bucket               = "terraform-state-lock-env" 

    dynamodb_table       = "terraform-state-lock-env" 

 

terraform apply the sequence: 

1terraform-state-setup - creates the s3 bucket and dynamodb table for remote state tracking 

2cloudsearch_setup - creates the cloudsearch domain and index fields 

3application_support_setup - create the VPC, API Gateway, Lambda functions, S3 objects, Security Groups, etc

4applications - create and configure the EMR cluster with cron jobs to trigger daily crawl
